# Docker image for standalone Spark testing
A Spark v1.2.0 Docker image for local testing. It's based on the image from prodriguezdefino/hadoop-2.6.0-base (found in https://github.com/prodriguezdefino/docker-hadoop-2.6.0-base).

In order to start using the Spark console with this image we can build the image with (after checking out the repo):

docker build -t "NAME-OF-YOUR-IMAGE" .

Then find image's ID with:

docker images

Finally running docker run -i -t <IMAGE-ID> /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash we will access the interactive console.
